Authentication:

After initializing your socket to the server you need to authenticate :

Your fantom client must send "fantom connection" then wait for "connection accepted" to be authenticated
Your inspector client must send "inspector connection" then wait for "connection accepted" to be authenticated

During the authentication if you receive "connection refused" it probably means that there is too much simultaneous connections
retry later
