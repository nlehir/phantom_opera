Authentication:

After initializing your socket to the server you need to authenticate :

Your fantom client must send "fantom connection email@epitech.eu" then wait for "connection accepted" to be authenticated
Your inspector client must send "inspector connection email@epitech.eu" then wait for "connection accepted" to be authenticated

During the authentication if you receive "connection refused" it probably means that there is too much simultaneous connections
retry later
